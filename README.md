## Introduction 

This dataset is a catalogue of rides taken on the LA-Metro Bike Share Network.

"The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, Port of LA and the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around."

Bike sharing networks have been established in cities of all sizes, they allow residents and visitors a fun, cheap, fast and  easy way to explore the city they are based in and have even become part of regular commuter routines. Although a bicycle is in itself a low-tech transport option, technology has and will continue to play major role in the rapid expansion of bike sharing networks. The bike may be dumb (and they increasingly aren't) but the network itself is very smart.

"Now companies have GPS sensors to track their bikes, and smartphones, credit cards, or transit passes to know who has themâ€”and whom to penalize if the wheels go missing. Riders, meanwhile, can use apps to track down available rides or bike-share stations when they need them."

And data collection and analysis and with it machine learning is the key to building a bike network that really works. Data can provide many insights and much guidance about a bike sharing network and through this exploration of the LA-Metro Bike Network I hope to demonstrate just some of this potential.
